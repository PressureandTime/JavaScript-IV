// CODE here for your Lambda Classes


// First we need a Person class. This will be our base-class
// Person receives name age location gender all as props
// Person receives speak as a method.
// This method logs out a phrase Hello my name is Fred, 
// I am from Bedrock where name and location are the object's own props





class Person {
  constructor(personAttributes) {
    this.name = personAttributes.name;
    this.age = personAttributes.age;
    this.location = personAttributes.location;
  }

  speak() {
    return `Hello my name is ${this.name}, I am from ${this.location}`;
  }

}
